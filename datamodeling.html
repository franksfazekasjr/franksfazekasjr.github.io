            Conceptual, logical and physical data models:
        </p>
        <p class="first-paragraph">
          Data models are blueprints that define how data is structured, organized, and managed within a system. There are three main levels of data modeling, each with a distinct purpose and level of detail:
        </p>
        <p>
          Conceptual Data Model (CDM):
            Focus: High-level overview of the data entities and their relationships in a business context.
            Target Audience: Business stakeholders, analysts, and data architects.
            Key Features:
              Uses business-oriented terminology (e.g., customers, orders, products).
              Focuses on identifying core entities, their attributes (data points), and the relationships between them.
              Doesn't consider specific database technologies or implementation details.
              Often represented visually using Entity-Relationship Diagrams (ERDs) or other high-level diagrams.
        </p>
        <p>
          Logical Data Model (LDM):

          Focus: Detailed description of the data structure independent of specific database technologies.
          Target Audience: Data architects, database designers, and developers.
          Key Features:
         <blockquote>
          <hr />
          <p class="quote">
            It's a valuable resource that can talk to the business to develop the conceptual model then turn around and develop the logical and physical models...
          </p>
          <hr />
        </blockquote>
            Refines the entities and attributes defined in the CDM.
            Defines data types (e.g., integer, string, date) for each attribute.
            Establishes primary and foreign keys to manage data relationships.
            May include constraints or rules governing data integrity.
            Still technology-agnostic, focusing on the logical structure of the data.
            Often represented using ERDs with more detailed attributes and constraints or other data modeling tools.
        </p>
        <p>
          Physical Data Model (PDM):

          Focus: Detailed representation of the data structure specific to a chosen database management system (DBMS).
          Target Audience: Database developers and administrators.
          Key Features:
            Translates the LDM into the specific data structures supported by the chosen DBMS.
            Considers factors like data storage types (e.g., tables, columns, indexes) supported by the database.
            May involve optimization techniques for specific database performance.
            Often represented using the database's specific data definition language (DDL).
        </p>
        <p>
          In summary, each data model builds upon the previous one, gradually adding details and translating the data structure into a format suitable for implementation within a specific database system.

            Developing star schema data warehouse data models:
          </p>
          <p class="first-paragraph">
            Here's a the process I use for for developing a data warehouse star schema data model:
          </p>
          <p>
            Define Business Requirements:
              Understand the Business: Begin by gathering a clear understanding of the business goals and objectives. What information is crucial for decision-making? Which business processes generate the data you need to track?
              Identify Key Performance Indicators (KPIs): Determine the key metrics that will be used to measure success and track performance across different areas of the business.
          </p>
          <p>
            Identify Data Sources:
              Locate Relevant Data Sources: Pinpoint the various sources of data that will feed into the data warehouse. This could include transactional databases, operational systems, CRM systems, and other data repositories.
              Data Quality Assessment: Evaluate the quality of the data from each source. Ensure the data is accurate, consistent, and complete for reliable analysis.
          </p>
          <p>
            Design the Dimensional Model:
              Identify Dimensions: Dimensions are descriptive attributes that provide context for the fact data (measures). Examples include time, product, customer, location, etc. Each dimension should have a unique identifier (primary key) to link it to the fact table.
              Define Dimension Hierarchies: For some dimensions, explore hierarchical relationships between attributes. For instance, a "time" dimension might have a hierarchy of year, quarter, month, day.
              Attribute Selection: Choose the most relevant attributes for each dimension, considering factors like business needs and storage optimization.
          </p>
        <blockquote>
          <hr/>
          <p class="quote">
            The denormalizing of fact tables can feel "weird" compared to developing a transactional or OLTP datamodel, however, the performance benefits cannot be ignored...
          </p>
          <hr/>
        </blockquote>
          <p>
            Design the Fact Table:
              Identify Facts (Measures): These are the quantitative metrics you want to analyze, like sales amount, unit sold, average transaction value, etc.
              Foreign Keys: The fact table will have foreign keys referencing the primary keys of each dimension table. This establishes the relationships between dimensions and facts.
              Grain of Fact Table: Define the level of detail at which the facts will be stored. This could be transaction-level, daily, monthly, etc., depending on your business needs and data granularity requirements.
          </p>
          <p>
            Refine and Normalize (Optional):
              Normalization: While star schemas are generally denormalized for performance reasons, limited normalization might be applied to dimension tables to reduce redundancy if needed.
              Iterate and Refine: Review the model with stakeholders and business users. Based on their feedback, refine the data model to ensure it meets their needs effectively.
          </p>
          <p>
            Documentation and Implementation:
              Document the Model: Create clear and comprehensive documentation outlining the data model design decisions, including dimension and fact table details, relationships, and data types.
              Data Transformation and Loading: Develop processes to extract, transform, and load (ETL) data from source systems to the data warehouse, ensuring data integrity and consistency.
          </p>
          <p>
            The following tools and techniques can help you in your development:
              Data Modeling Tools: Several data modeling tools can help visualize and document the star schema design.
              ER Diagrams: Entity-Relationship Diagrams (ERDs) are commonly used to represent the relationships between dimensions and facts in the star schema.
          </p>
          <p>
            In conclusion, by following these steps and considering these factors, you can develop a star schema data model that effectively supports data warehousing and business intelligence needs. Remember, this is a cyclical process, and you might need to revisit and refine the model based on evolving business requirements and data analysis needs.

          <p>

          </p>
          <p>
            In conclusion, I cannot emphasize enough to use the appropriate data type for the appropriate use in the database.  Even if "everybody's doing it" question everything, do your own experimentation, trust your conclusions based on empirical evidence.

              <p>
                We launched freeCodeCamp with a simple list of 15 resources,
                including Harvard's CS50 and Stanford's Database Class.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h4 class="list-subtitle">V2 - 2015</h4>
              <p>We added interactive algorithm challenges.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h4 class="list-subtitle">V3 - 2015</h4>
              <p>
                We added our own HTML+CSS challenges (before we'd been relying on
                General Assembly's Dash course for these).
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h4 class="list-subtitle">V4 - 2016</h4>
              <p>
                We expanded the curriculum to 3 certifications, including Front
                End, Back End, and Data Visualization. They each had 10 required
                projects, but only the Front End section had its own challenges.
                For the other certs, we were still using external resources like
                Node School.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h4 class="list-subtitle">V5 - 2017</h4>
              <p>We added the back end and data visualization challenges.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h4 class="list-subtitle">V6 - 2018</h4>
              <p>
                We launched 6 new certifications to replace our old ones. This was
                the biggest curriculum improvement to date.
